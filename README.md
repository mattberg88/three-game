## Install and Run
To install packages run: `npm i`.
To start server run: `npm start`.

## Building the project for the web
Once you are happy with your project you'll be sure to want to show it off. Running `npm run build` in terminal will bundle your project into the folder `./build/`. You can upload this directory to a web server. For more complex results read [this guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/).
